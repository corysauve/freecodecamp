# Scientific Computing with Python 
## Introduction 

### Python for Everybody 

- Code: sequence of stored instructions 

### Hardware Architecture 

- Central processing unit 
    - "Brain of the computer" 
- Main memory 
    - Fast small temporary storage 
    - lost at reboot 
    - Feeds instructions to CPU
- Hard drive (secondary storage)
    - slower large permanent storage 
    - lasts until deleted 
- Input devices 
    - keyboard, mouse, touch screen 
- Output devices 
    - Screen, speakers, printer

- Programmer lives in the main memory 

### Elements of Python 

- Reserved words 
  - Cannot use reserved words as variable names/identifiers 
  - e.g., False, None, True, def 

- Interactive v. script 
    - Interactive = you type directly to Python one line at a time and it responds 
    - Script = You enter a sequence of statements (lines) into a file using a text editor and tell Python to execute the statements in the file 

- Elements of python 
    - Sequential
    - Repeated 
    - Conditional
